TO-DOs

- add tests (waveform_tools)
    - attenuate trace with dt* = 0, should return trace
    - test metadata is correctly preserved 
    - test helper functions

- add tests to synthetics.py
    - Make msac test data to compare to 
        - should generate identical Gabor wavelet with same, phi ,dt
        - test sws and dt* seperatly 

- add measurement tools

- think about combination with forward modelling repo?

- requirements.txt

- move debug_ifft notebook to notebooks/ 
    - checksums and dt* testing should be re-written as proper tests
