# Hello World

This repo contains some tools for measuring attenuation anisotropy using instantaneous frequency matching and for generating simple synthetics.

If you use this code please cite:

For examples on how some of these tools can be used please see the supplementary notebook for this paper on Zenodo https://zenodo.org/records/10641152

Further work to improve the usability of this code is ongoing...
