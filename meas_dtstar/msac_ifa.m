% MSAC_IFA
% Calculate the instantaneous frequency, amplitude and phase of an input 
% seismic trace.
%
% Usage: 
%     [inamp,infreq] = msac_ifa(tr)                    
%         Produce instantaneous amplitude and frequency traces from an input
%         seismic trace (in SAC format). 
%
%	  [...] = msac_ifa(...,'weight',wlength) ;
%		  Apply an amplitude weighting to the instantaneous frequency, using
%         a sliding window of wlength (seconds). The weight is determined
%         from the envelope function.
%
%	  [inamp,infreq,inph] = msac_ifa(...)
%         Optionally also return the instantaneous phase.
